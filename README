Events which will be studied here are processed on localgrid.
The corresponding directory is:

/localgrid/aolbrech/NewestMW_amcnlo_EDependentTF/mg5amcnlo/ttbarSemiMu_QED2_Restr/

The scripts which will be stored in this directory were all developed in the following localgrid copy:

LocalGridCopy/NewestMW_amcnlo_PTDependentTF/mg5amcnlo/ttbarSemiMuPlus_QED2_CKMRestrictions

However since this directory is stored with old tests, the final analysis (gR only) will be solely done here.
A separate Git branch is created for this directory, which is branched off from the "LocalGrid_PtTF_ttMuPl_CKMRestrictions" one.
This branch used to only contain the scripts, while for this "FinalAnalysis_ScriptsAndResults" it is intended to also store some of the important results.
